Ryerson 2020 Computer Engineering Capstone Project - Fake News Prediction

https://www.ee.ryerson.ca/capstone/topics/2019/EB01.html

Background
The purpose of this notebook is to extract from the liar dataset [https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip] the 15 features out of the feature list in the paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00315.pdf], and train models on the datasets, and analyze the efficacy of different features with multiple ML models.

Our team of four set out to:

- familiarize ourselves with current research on fake news prediction
- design features that can improve prediction accuracy of current models
- implement machine learning models that can take text input and output prediction results
