Ryerson 2020 Computer Engineering Capstone Project - Fake News Prediction

https://www.ee.ryerson.ca/capstone/topics/2019/EB01.html

Background
The purpose of this notebook is to train a binary classification model based on the liar dataset [https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip], that determines whether a statement snipped from a news article is true news or false news (misinformation or disinformation).

Our model features were selected from the feature list of current fake news research [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00315.pdf], feature selection is performed and multiples models were tested to select the one with the best accuracy score.

Our team of four set out to:

- familiarize ourselves with current research on fake news prediction
- design features that can improve prediction accuracy of current models
- implement machine learning models that can take text input and output prediction results

## Getting Started
